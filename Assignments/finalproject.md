# Final Project - Contrasting River Styles


The core of your final project will be to read riverscapes in three to four contrasting reaches in a watershed of your choosing (other than the Logan River) and to properly characterize them.  You will use the tools you have developed all semester long, and those four "steps" to reading riverscapes identified in [Chapter 1](https://riverscapes.github.io/Fluvial-Geomorphology/Course_Topics/module-01.html). 

The riverscapes you choose should be long enough in length to be representative (e.g. typically 500 m to  2000 m depending on size of system). The riverscapes should be somewhere you have visited in person or (ideally) can visit in person to complete the assignment. The selection of riverscapes reaches, should collectively satisfy the following criterions:
-  At least one confined riverscape
-  At least one partly-confined riverscape 
-  At least one laterally unconfined riverscape
-  All in one watershed and preferably along same water course (e.g. like our field trip on the Logan River where we stopped at five locations along the way)

As always, you will be preparing a web page (or series of nested sub-pages) on your class website for the assignment. As we unpack expectations for how to complete this assignment, I will post them here.
