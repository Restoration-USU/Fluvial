# Module 4 Field Notebook: Hydrology Bingo

## The Assignment

You are required to get your field notebook page on your website setup and at least  two processes observed by February 3. In setting it up, you need to commit to (and stick with the whole semester) one bingo card. The real assignment will run all semester long. You need to get "Bingo" by the end of the semester. The first three to declare Bingo (and not have their results contested) will get a prize and a Grand Prize will go to the first Full Card winner.

## The Rules
In normal Bingo you all get different bingo cards. Here, you have four  bingo cards to choose from below. Your job is to get Bingo by one of the following winning patterns:

The way you record your processes will be as follows:
Show on your web page, which bingo cell you are reporting. Keep a running list of all cells below as sub-heading sub-sections in which you:
- denote the process you are reporting
- provide a one sentence definition of process
- show us the process (preferably a video narrated) in action (or a very well annotated photo or series of photos) from your own local field observations.
- explain why you think it is that process

Your observations must be your own (no re-using of other's YouTube videos.. though you can use them for inspiration). You need to observe these processes in the field.

## The Bingo Cards

All have the same mix of processes... just in order. Choose one, and stick to it.

### Card 1

| drizzle (precipitation) | sheet flow (interill) | pipeflow                          | infiltration         | percolation       |
| overbank flow           | snow throughfall       | infiltration excess overland flow | throughflow          | snow accumulation |
| rain (precipitation)    | base flow             | throughflow                      | snow (precipitation) | condensation      |
| sublimation             | interception          | saturation excess overland flow   | evaporation          | bankfull flow     |
| gully flow              | stemflow              | subsurface stormflow              | rill flow            | return flow       |

| gully flow              | stemflow              | subsurface stormflow              | rill flow            | return flow       |
| drizzle (precipitation) | sheet flow (interill) | pipeflow                          | infiltration         | percolation       |
| rain (precipitation)    | base flow             | throughflow                      | snow (precipitation) | condensation      |

### Card 4

| drizzle (precipitation) | sheet flow (interill) | pipeflow                          | infiltration         | percolation     |
