This online resource is designed primarily for students enrolled in the introductory fluvial geomorphology courses, including [WATS 5150/6150](/syllabus/), [GEO 5150/6150](/syllabus/), and [CEWA 6150](/syllabus/) taught through [Utah State University](https://qcnr.usu.edu/wats/). However, it also serves as a valuable introduction to the fascinating field of fluvial geomorphology and will build an appreciation of riverscapes for students and practitioners seeking knowledge in this area.

## Canvas for Assignments & Pacing

For enrolled students, all course materials, such as lectures, videos and resources you may want to refer to long after the class  can be found on this site. By contrast, [Canvas](https://usu.instructure.com) is where you will submit assignments, track your grades, view due dates for assignments and meetings,  and engage in collaborations:
