2. Differentiate influence of extenrnal controls (e.g. climate and catchment) vs. local controls on form and process. 
4. Recognize the primary controls on riverscape diversity, in which distinctive suites of physical and biotic processes (behavior) help shape the form and character of those landscapes. 
7. Gain an appreciation of how geomorphic processes of erosion, deposition transport and storage of sediment shape topography and create, maintain, sculpt and destroy distincitive landforms.
