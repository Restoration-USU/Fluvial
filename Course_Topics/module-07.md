# Module 7: Channel Geometry - Topography

## Background

### Why we're covering it

### [Learning Outcomes]({{ site.baseurl }}/syllabus/#course-objectives)

1. Confidently *read* any riverscape and be able to map its core characteristics.

2. Differentiate influence of external controls (e.g., climate and catchment) vs. local controls on form and process. 

3. Apply principles of geomorphic analysis to a diversity of riverscapes.

4. Recognize the primary controls on riverscape diversity, in which distinctive suites of physical and biotic processes (behavior) help shape the form and character of those landscapes. 

5. Appreciate that topography is a quantitative record of landforms and apply morphometric analysis can be used to map and differentiate those landforms (i.e., geomorphic units).
