# Module 12: River Evolution

## Background

River evolution is the term Fryirs and Brierley use to describe the long term trajectory of "change" of routine river adjustments (i.e. normal behavior) within a riverscape. When such changes to behavior are pronounced enough, there is a change from river style  from one flavor to another (e.g. a single thread meandering river to a braided river). Such changes are typically due to a change in flux boundary conditions and these can be driven by changes in climate, tectonics and geologic forcing, and or anthropogenic changes (e.g. Chapter 13). 

### [Learning Outcomes]({{ site.baseurl }}/syllabus/#course-objectives)

3. Apply principles of geomorphic analysis to a diversity of riverscapes.
4. Gain an appreciation of how geomorphic processes of erosion, deposition transport and storage of sediment shape topography and create, maintain, sculpt and destroy distinctive landforms.
